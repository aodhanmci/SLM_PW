Code which controls a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a Basler Camera in a closed loop to optimise the near field of the laser beam. 

The GUI is built in Tkinter and should be cross platform. 

The SLM to be used is arbitary since it should be recognised as an auxiliary display. 

Current a Basler camera is required for full closed loop iteration, but this can be subsitituded for camera with a python based API
